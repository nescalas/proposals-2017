## Abstract

CBT gets dangerously close to a true and complete 1.0 now. Have you read or written advanced _sbt_ builds? Have you understood _sbt_'s axis, task scoping and configurations? With one simple concept CBT solves all the same use cases and more. You'll truely understand it in 5 minutes. This and more elegant solutions to all major problems discovered over the last year will be live demoed in this talk. Including an elegant way to use CBT for FP/library-style builds without inheritance. Get ready for the future.
