## Abstract

This talk discusses and demos property-based testing. After providing a high-level overview of what it is and its benefits, the talk will demo the application of ScalaCheck on a simple data structure.

## Description

Although types detect errors, serve as documentation, and provide abstraction*, "I want to use every possible tool to help me design, verify, and troubleshoot my code" (http://conscientiousprogrammer.com/blog/2015/12/03/24-days-of-hackage-2015-day-3-hspec-the-importance-of-testing/)!

In this presentation, I will walk through the benefits of property-driven. Finally, I will demo the application of property-based tests, using ScalaCheck, on a simple data structure.

## Notes



## Bio
  
I've been working with Scala professionally since late 2013. Primarily, I've developed web services on the server/platform side. 

In late 2015 I co-organized [Miami Scala Enthusiasts](https://www.meetup.com/Miami-Scala-Enthusiasts). I've presented the following topics at this meetup:
• [Intro to Scala/FP ](http://www.meetup.com/Miami-Scala-Enthusiasts/events/230869024/)
• [Domain Design and Error Handling with Types](https://www.meetup.com/Miami-Scala-Enthusiasts/events/234696961/)
• [Scala Workshop](https://www.meetup.com/Miami-Scala-Enthusiasts/events/235444639/)

Currently, I'm learning shapeless!
