## Description

Reactive applications are becoming a de-facto industry standard and, if employed correctly, toolkits like Lightbend Reactive Platform make the implementation easier than ever. But the design of these systems might be challenging as it requires particular mindset shift to tackle problems we might not be used to. In this talk, we’re going to discuss the most common things I’ve seen in the field that prevented applications to work as expected. I’d like to talk about typical pitfalls that might cause troubles, about trade-offs that might not be fully understood or important choices that might be overlooked including persistent actors pitfalls, tackling of network partitions, proper implementations of graceful shutdown or distributed transactions, trade-offs of micro-services or actors and more.

This talk should be interesting for anyone who is thinking about, implementing, or have already deployed a reactive application. My goal is to provide is to provide a comprehensive explanation of common problems to be sure they won’t be repeated by fellow developers. The talk is a little bit more focused on the Lightbend platform but understanding of the concepts we are going to talk about should be beneficial for everyone interested in this field.
